# app-forms

A simple Angular framework for rapid development of SharePoint hosted and SharePoint data stored apps. This allows for list views, submission forms, task forms, emails, approvals, audit etc. 

This was originally an AngularJS/JavaScript coded, simplified version of Nintex/PowerPlatform but based on the now deprecated AngularJS, due to when the work began. It requires a content web part or script editor web part or a modern equivelent of these. As there were so many deprecated requirements here then it is uploaded as is with unlikely/minimal further development to the AngularJS version but may be of use for rapid prototyping or fall back interfaces.

The Angular2+ version is an initial concept to recreate this within newer versions of Angular (11 currently) within an SPFx package.
